# The What and Why of WordPress Security

I'm sure you've read at least one "Guide to WordPress Security" or "Top Ten Tips to Keep 
Your WordPress Site Safe" articles. Maybe you even implemented a few, or all, of the

they accomplished?  In this session will discuss the most common security suggestions for

* Why they are suggested
* What they accomplish
* When you should apply them (and when you shouldn't)
* How they tie back to core security principles
* How we can augment these suggestions to build an even more robust security posture
